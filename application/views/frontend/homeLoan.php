																		<p>There are many reasons due to which one should consider home loan as a very important investment cum savings tool</p>
																	<ul style="padding-left:30px;">
																		<li>These are the cheapest form of loans available in the market, at a very nominal margin above the base rate of most banks and a very narrow range. Presently, all home loans are between 10 to 11%.</li>

																		<li>There are tax exemption on repayment of both principal and interest</li>

																		<li>There is no prepayment or foreclosure charges hence any surplus money at any point of time can be used to reduce the loan burden, if required.</li>
																	</ul>
																	   <b></b>
																	   <p>
																	     <ul style="padding-left:30px;">
																		 <li>Experience of owning a house can’t be undermined</li>
																		<li>Income tax benefit on the principal repayment is available under section 80C (max 1.5 lacs)</li>
																		<li>Income tax rebate on repayment of the interest is available under Section 24 for the self occupied property (max 1.5 lacs)</li>
																		<li>Additional tax exemption of Rs 1 Lac is given on interest repayment on any other property other than self-occupied property</li>
																			 </ul>
																	   <b>Eligibility</b>
																		Income: This is the most important parameter to judge the quantum of loan. The more the income, the more confidence bank has on your repayment.
																		Other Loan Holding: Eligibility for home loan decreases if there are existing loans as you need to pay those EMIs as well and thus; your effective income level goes down.
																		Credit History: Famously also known as CIBIL score, it help the bank in determining your track record for any other past loans.
																		Property Authenticity: Property for which the loan is taken should be legally and technically cleared by the local bodies and lawyers. It shouldn’t have any claims as it will be accepted as collateral for the home loan.

																			<b>S4L Expert’s Advice</b>
																			<p style="font-size:13px;font-family:verdana;">The best way is to take a pre sanction approval from a bank which is based on the individual’s financial strength. Usually these sanction letters are valid for 2-6 months varying among the banks.</p>
																			<p>Now, with a pre-sanction letter from a reputed lender, an individual can negotiate better while finalizing a property.</p>
																			<p>Also in this way, lot of time can be saved in the final disbursement process.
																			<p><u>Unlike other loans where the individual know the quantum of money he/she wants to borrow, in case of home loan it works the other way round. The individual determines the maximum loan he can avail then he/she tries to a property which fits in the budget</u></p>

                                                         <p>There are two types of interest rates available in the market:</p>
															<li><u>Fixed Rate</u>: In this option, interest rate for initial few years or for complete tenure remain fixed as decided in the initial agreement irrespective of market interest rate conditions.</li>
															<li><u>Floating Rate</u>: As the name suggests, the interest rate is dependent on economic conditions hence keep on fluctuating.</li><br />
                                                         <li><b>What should be kept in mind while taking a home loan?</b></li>
                                                         <p></p>
														 <li>Though usually the home loan interest rates in the market remains almost the same and very competitive among the bank but there can be enough difference in the loan tenure. One should take a comfortable tenure.</li>
														 <p>One should borrow only the max amount which he/she can repay comfortably. Missing on your EMIs or defaulting on your home loans will adversely affect the CIBIL score and thereby reducing chance to avail any other loan in future.</p>
