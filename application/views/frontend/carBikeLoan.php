											<p><strong>What one should keep in mind while selecting a car loan?</strong>
											</p>
											<ul style="padding-left:15px;">
												<li>The basic advice is to borrow only the amount which can be repaid comfortably because defaults and EMI bounce badly hurt the credit history of the borrower.</li>
												<li>In addition to negotiate on interest rate which we all know and do; one should also go into details on various charges points like processing fee, prepayment charges, foreclosure penalty.</li>
												<li>Always go into details if the offer looks too lucrative than normal market options</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<p><strong>The ultimate dilemma: New Car or Used Car</strong>
										</p>
										<p>One can buy a brand new Hyundai i20 or a used Honda Civic in almost the same price. This dilemma always exists so let's look at few pros and cons of both to help you arrive at the decision.
											<p><strong><u>Positives of buying a new car</u>:</strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												<ul style="padding-left:15px;">
													<li>No one can deny the unmatched experience of being the first owner with mechanical problems or any accidents history creating cranky noises.</li>
													<li>Not only this, new cars comes with latest gadgets and technology.</li>
													<li>The comprehensive warranty from the manufacturer itself gives a lot of comfort to the owner</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p><strong><u> Negatives of buying a new car</u>:</strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												<ul style="padding-left:15px;">
													<li>Its always expensive than the used car.</li>
													<li>It depreciates almost 20-30% immediately after it comes out of showroom.</li>
													<li>Insurance premium is also high and is an annual recurring cost</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p><strong><u>Positives of buying a used car</u>:</strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												<ul style="padding-left:15px;">
													<p>
														<li>Cost of buying (owning) is very low as compared to the new car</li>
														<li>Depreciation in used car is almost negligible so it retains almost all value when you wish to resell it.</li>
														<li>Since the car is already depreciated, its insurance cost is also minimal</li>
												</ul>
												</p>
												<p><strong><u>Negatives of buying a used car</u>:</strong>
												</p>
												<p>
													<ul style="padding-left:15px;">
														<li>Maintenance cost is comparatively higher because ultimately somebody before you has used it on roads only</li>
														<li>Since its past usage conditions and accidental history can't be completely judged, it becomes a risky proposition to own it in case you go wrong on your analysis.</li>
														<li>Used car loans are not as cheap as new car loan due to the obvious higher risk associated from the lender's perspective</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
											</p>
											<p>
												<p><strong>What are the documents required for car loan?</strong>
												</p>Along with basic KYC documentation like Photo ID Proof, Address Proof, Income Proof (Salary slips, bank statements, form 16); lenders also ask for Down Payment Receipt & Car Quotation</p>

											<ul style="list-style-type:none; font-size:13px;">
												<li><b>Can I Prepay my Car/Bike loan similar to Home Loan?</b>
												</li>
												<li>Yes, you can prepay your car/bike loan but unlike in case of home laon, here bank may charge for prepayment penalty. Many a times prepayment penalty applies till certain duration but since it varies from bank to bank & the agreement one has with bank, one should take such charges into account while making part payment of complete closure of loan.</li>
												<br />
												<li><b>Can I get better rate from same bank?</b>
												</li>
												<li>One can definitely negotiate with bank on various charges & rate of interest while applying for loan. Depending on your credit score, amount of loan & other parameters, bank can revise it charges exclusively for you. Make sure, such negotiated values are mentioned in the agreement you have with bank.</li>
												<br />
												<li><b>Can I get loan for 100% on road price of car?</b>
												</li>
												<li>Yes, but very few banks make such offers that too based on some special terms & conditions. Sometimes, some bank have special tie ups with certain car manufacturers, in such cases 100% on-road value financing can be seen.</li>
